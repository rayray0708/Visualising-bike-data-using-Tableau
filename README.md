## Introduction
As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I'm now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In this new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicise and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
